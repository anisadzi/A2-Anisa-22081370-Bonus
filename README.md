# Database
This new aplication task has three tables following the example configuration from the instruction file.

## Model

### `customer.model.js`
This file defines the **Customer** model, which represents the customer entity in the database. The model contains the following fields:

- **customer_id**: A unique identifier for each customer, set as an auto-incrementing primary key.
- **customer_name**: The name of the customer, stored as a string.
- **customer_email**: The email address of the customer, stored as a string.

This model is used to interact with the `customers` table in the database, providing methods to create, read, update, and delete customer records.

---

### `item.model.js`
This file defines the **Item** model, representing items in the store or inventory. The model consists of the following fields:

- **item_id**: A unique identifier for each item, set as an auto-incrementing primary key.
- **item_name**: The name of the item, stored as a string.
- **item_price**: The price of the item, stored as a string (this can be updated to a numerical type like `DECIMAL` if required for price calculations).

This model is used to interact with the `items` table in the database for managing item records.

---

### `order.model.js`
The **Order** model represents orders placed by customers for items. This model contains the following fields:

- **order_id**: A unique identifier for each order, set as an auto-incrementing primary key.
- **order_date**: The date the order was placed, defaulted to the current date and time using `Sequelize.NOW`.
- **customer_id**: A foreign key that links the order to a customer, referencing the `customer_id` field in the `customers` table.
- **item_id**: A foreign key that links the order to an item, referencing the `item_id` field in the `items` table.

Additionally, this model includes an **association function**:
- The `Order` belongs to both `Customer` and `Item` (via `customer_id` and `item_id`). This means that each order is related to a specific customer and a specific item.

---

### `index.js`
This file is the entry point for setting up and connecting the database using Sequelize. It contains the following components:

- **dbConfig**: Imports database configuration from an external `db.config.js` file.
- **Sequelize Initialization**: Establishes a connection to the database using the Sequelize ORM, based on the configuration in `dbConfig`.
- **Model Initialization**: Initializes the `items`, `customers`, and `orders` models and associates them with the database connection (`sequelize`).
- **Association Definitions**: Defines the relationships between models:
  - An `Order` belongs to both `Customer` and `Item` (using the foreign keys `customer_id` and `item_id`).
  - A `Customer` can have many `Orders`, and an `Item` can be part of many `Orders`.

The `db` object is populated with the models and exported, making them accessible throughout the rest of the application.

---
